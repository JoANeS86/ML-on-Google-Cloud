## Introduction to AI and Machine Learning on Google Cloud

<ins>Artificial intelligence</ins>, or <ins>AI</ins>, is an umbrella term that includes anything related to computers mimicking human intelligence. Some examples of AI applications include robots and self-driving cars.

<ins>Machine learning</ins> is a subset of AI that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This is in contrast to traditional programming, where the computer is told explicitly what to do. Machine learning mainly includes supervised and unsupervised learning.

You might also hear the terms <ins>Deep Learning</ins> or <ins>Deep Neural Networks</ins>. This is a subset of Machine Learning that adds layers in between input data and output results to make a machine learn at more depth. You'll learn more about Neural Networks and Deep Learning later in this course.

Lastly is <ins>Generative AI</ins>, which produces content and performs tasks based on requests. Generative AI relies on training extensive models like Large Language Models. These models are a type of Deep Learning model.

<ins>Pre-trained APIs</ins>: Here you directly call Google's train models to solve your problems.

    - Speech, text and language APIs.
    - Image and video APIs.
    - Document and data APIs.
    - Conversational AI APIs.
    
<ins>Vertex AI</ins>: Unified platform that supports various technologies and tools on Google Cloud to help you build an ML project from end to end.

<ins>AutoML</ins>: AutoML, which stands for Automated Machine Learning, aims to automate the process to develop and deploy an ML model.

<ins>Custom training</ins>: You do it yourself solution to build an ML project.

**AI Development Workflow**

There are three main stages to the ML workflow with Vertex AI.

        - Data preparation:
        
                Two steps: Data uploading and feature engineering.
                Data types: Streaming versus batch data, and structured versus unstructured data.
                
        - Data development: A model needs a tremedous amount of iterative training (Train the model, evaluate it,
        train the model some more).

        - Model serving: Deploy and monitor the model.

Compare this process to serving food in a restaurant. Data preparation is when you prepare the raw ingredients, model development is when you experiment with different recipes, and model serving is when you finalize the menu to serve the meal to customers.

**It's important to note that an ML workflow isn't linear, it's iterative.**
