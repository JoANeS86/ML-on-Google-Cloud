## AI and ML

<ins>Artificial intelligence</ins>, or <ins>AI</ins>, is an umbrella term that includes anything related to computers mimicking human intelligence. Some examples of AI applications include robots and self-driving cars.

<ins>Machine learning</ins> is a subset of AI that allows computers to learn without being explicitly programmed. This is in contrast to traditional programming, where the computer is told explicitly what to do. Machine learning mainly includes supervised and unsupervised learning.

You might also hear the terms <ins>Deep Learning</ins> or <ins>Deep Neural Networks</ins>. This is a subset of Machine Learning that adds layers in between input data and output results to make a machine learn at more depth. You'll learn more about Neural Networks and Deep Learning later in this course.

Lastly is <ins>Generative AI</ins>, which produces content and performs tasks based on requests. Generative AI relies on training extensive models like Large Language Models. These models are a type of Deep Learning model.
